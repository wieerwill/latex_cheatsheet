# LaTex Cheatsheet
This little package helps you create small cheatsheets for about everything. 

Take a look at my [Informatik](https://github.com/wieerwill/informatik) Repo where it is used quite often.

This work is under development, you can use it as you like. Help and Ideas are welcome.

## How to use
To use the package, just import it at the top of your LaTex file before `\begin{document}`. Like this:
```tex
\usepackage{cheatsheet}
```

You can see a working example right in this repository:
- as [PDF](sample.pdf)
- and [source tex](sample.tex)
